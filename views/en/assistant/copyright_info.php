    <h2>Respect copyright law: The basics</h2>
    <p>The most important basic rule: a work belongs to the people who created it. They determine how the work may be used.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to use or pass on to your students something that you have not created yourself, you must always check whether you are allowed to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some common misunderstandings:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You may not copy and distribute things that you find on the Internet just because they are freely accessible. Check whether a license is indicated on the website that allows you to pass on the material. If not, just link to the website.</li>
        <li>Works created by students, including term papers, theses, etc. belong solely to the students and may not be used without their explicit consent.</li>
        <li>Even in the closed room of a course you are not allowed to pass on copyrighted works without further investigation. You can read more about this in the section "What may I use in teaching?".</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Respect copyright law: What may I use in teaching?</h2>
    <p>
        For courses you can use copyrighted works by third parties in the following cases:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Free licenses are available (Open Access, Open Educational Resource).</li>
        <li>You are using small parts from books (up to 15%) or individual articles from scientific journals (use of §§ 60a, 60c UrhG).</li>
        <li>You have a separate authorization or license from the copyright holders.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;<br>
        Electronic resources licensed through the library should be linked rather than re-uploaded.
    </p>

        There are many more questions in detail. We recommend the (geman) guide "Urheberrechts-FAQ Hochschullehre" by Achim Förster: <a href="https://urheberrecht.fhws.de/faq-urheberrecht/">https://urheberrecht.fhws.de/faq-urheberrecht/</a>.
